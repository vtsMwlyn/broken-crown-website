When Kazmiel Elandys, an unstoppable force, effortlessly defeated Nykos, the spear’s wielder, and his army, Dyrnazel bonded with her, igniting with newfound power. With Nyxopolis fallen and its legacy shattered, the spear now rests in Kazmiel’s hands, awaiting the day it demands another true battle to determine the strongest once more.',

Its wielder, a powerful mage, insists it is her greatest weapon and the source of her power, yet in the hands of others, it functions as nothing more than an ornate rapier. The blade indeed contains the essence of a certain seraph’s divinity, lending credence to the mage’s claims. However, no tangible evidence suggests that the weapon gives the wielder divine powers.',

However, since Dyrnazel’s disappearance and the Elandys family’s adoption of the Seraphic Blade Extharion, newer generations of Elite Guards have begun shifting toward swords, sparking debate over whether the spear’s legacy will endure.',
