To sustain their survival, its inhabitants are forced to raid neighboring nations relentlessly. The island is geographically divided into two distinct regions: the Highlands and the Lowlands. The Highlands are home to affluent supporters of the Queen, who benefit from the spoils of conquest, while the Lowlands house those who oppose her pillaging ways, living in impoverished conditions as a result.',

Though nobody can explain its luminous properties, many reverently regard it as sacred, dubbing it "holy water" and attributing mystical significance to its glow.

More than mere entertainment, the arena serves as a proving ground where people could endure trials to become guards, settle disputes between citizens, and find out the true mightiest warrior. Its a testament to Eldynia\'s belief that only the strong has the right to lead.',
