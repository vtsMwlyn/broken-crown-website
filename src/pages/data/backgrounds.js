		desc: 'Known as the Island of Eternal Winter, is a barren and inhospitable land where vegetation cannot thrive, and resources are exceedingly scarce. To sustain their survival, its inhabitants are forced to raid neighboring nations relentlessly. The island is geographically divided into two distinct regions: the Highlands and the Lowlands. The Highlands are home to affluent supporters of the Queen, who benefit from the spoils of conquest, while the Lowlands house those who oppose her pillaging ways, living in impoverished conditions as a result.',
